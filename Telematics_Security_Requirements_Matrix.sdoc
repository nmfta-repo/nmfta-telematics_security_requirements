TITLE: Foreword

[FREETEXT]
After the US DOT/Volpe published “Telematics Cybersecurity Primer for Agencies” in June 2017, we wanted to create resources for use by our motor freight carrier members to procure new telematics systems such as Electronic Logging Devices (ELD). Starting with the telematics cybersecurity controls and recommendations made by the Primer, a working group was assembled to complete a detailed list of testable cybersecurity requirements for all the components of a telematics system. We are fortunate to have been able to collaborate with DOT/Volpe and to see the efforts of the working group come to fruition through the publication of this report, which is a natural refinement of the security controls defined in the Primer.

TITLE: Executive Summary

[FREETEXT]
The purpose of this document is to provide government agency Fleet
Managers and private industry stakeholders (e.g. TSPs, carriers, OEMs,
Tier 1 suppliers, and others) responsible for the selection and
procurement of Telematics, Fleet Management Information Systems (FMIS)
and/or ELDs with situational awareness of potential cybersecurity risks
of deploying such systems. This report also delivers a comprehensive
list of cybersecurity requirements that should be satisfied by all
components of a Telematics, Fleet Management Information System (FMIS)
and/or Electronic Logging Devices (ELD), including validation steps for
federal agencies and private industry stakeholders when deploying such
systems.

The audience for this report is the agencies and private industry stakeholders responsible for the selection and procurement of Telematics, Fleet Management Information Systems (FMIS) and/or ELDs, as was the case in the previously released “Telematics Cybersecurity Primer for Agencies” report. The working group believes that any stakeholder that must procure Telematics, FMIS and/or ELDs will also find the requirements outlined in this document relevant. The complete list of requirements outlined in Appendix A will remain a living document which can respond to feedback from industry and technical experts. The requirements are hosted at https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta- telematics_security_requirements and readers are encouraged to check there for updates to, and to offer feedback on, the requirements.

The comprehensive list of cybersecurity requirements for Telematics, FMIS and/or ELDs presented here was developed in collaboration with a diverse working group. The requirements are prioritized and include references to public authoritative sources containing more information, should the reader require additional details. The complete listing will provide purchasers with sufficient information to prioritize the need for cybersecurity in the Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD as well as validate the presence of the controls upon delivery of a system.

It is the recommendation of the working group that agencies and private stakeholders use these cybersecurity requirements when procuring new Telematics, FMIS and/or ELDs as well as when evaluating their current systems when the need to evaluate cybersecurity arises. The working group continues to refine the requirements and the reader is encouraged to visit https://github.com/nmfta- repo/nmfta-telematics_security_requirements to obtain the most up-to-date copy of the requirements, which is also available in a supplier questionnaire format. The site should also be used to give feedback to the working group on ways that the requirements can be further refined. It is NMFTA’s recommendation that motor freight carriers use these requirements as a natural successor to “Telematics Cybersecurity Primer for Agencies.”

The complete list of cybersecurity requirements can be found in Appendix A. Requirements are prioritized for use by stakeholders via a Criticality field to encourage adoption incrementally. These requirements are presented for all the components of a Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD: Vehicle Connection, Connectivity/Communications, Mobile App, and Cloud or Back-end and must be taken in their entirety for any assurances of cybersecurity to be realized.

[SECTION]
TITLE: Introduction

[FREETEXT]
The deployment of Telematics, FMIS and/or ELDs in motor vehicles is
pervasive today. As with any Information System (IS), it is the
owner/operator of that system who bears the responsibility for managing
the security of that system. This includes security of the information
being collected, managed and stored, but also the security of the assets
being monitored which – if not considered in procurement – could have
their security posture worsened by the introduction of a Telematics,
FMIS and/or ELD. In the case of agencies as the owners of an IS, their
responsibility is detailed in the Federal Information Security
Management Act of 2014[^1].

A core objective of this document is to provide information to owners of
Telematics, FMIS and/or ELDs in the phases of procurement of these
systems so they can manage risks to security. An additional objective is
to provide comprehensive cybersecurity requirements that can be
consulted by the owner and potential vendors to provide sufficient
information that can prioritize the needs for cybersecurity in the
Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD and validate the presence of the controls
upon delivery of the system.

The approach taken to create this list included consultations with many
authoritative sources of cybersecurity controls and then mapping them to
the components of a Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD. To do this, the report
considers a simplified model of a Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD. The four
components of such a simplified system are broken down by *Vehicle
Connection*, *Connectivity/Communications*, *Mobile App*, and *Cloud or
Back-end* and are depicted in the figure below:

.. image:: media/telematics-diagram.png
   :alt: Figure 1. Abstracted Telematics, Fleet Management Information Systems (FMIS) and/or ELD
   :class: image

The Cybersecurity Requirements for Telematics Systems matrix uses the
following terms for the components of a Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD:

-  *Vehicle Connection Device* – The component of Telematics, FMIS
   and/or ELD that is connected to vehicle networks -- tractor and/or
   trailer. There may also be a Human Machine Interface (HMI) aspect to
   this component. In cases where the HMI is a separate device from that
   which connects to vehicular networks, then all the requirements
   identified as being applicable to the ‘Mobile App’ (see below) should
   be considered to apply to the HMI device.

-  *Connectivity/Communications* – The component of a Telematics, FMIS
   and/or ELD which communicates data with the *Cloud or Back-end* (see
   below). This may or may not be the same device as the *Vehicle
   Connection Device*. In cases where they are the same device, both
   sets of the requirements identified as being applicable to a *Vehicle
   Connection Device* and the requirements identified as being
   applicable to *Connectivity/Communications* components should be
   considered to apply to the device.

-  *Cloud or Back-end* – The component or components of a Telematics,
   FMIS and/or ELD which are internet facing, where data is collected,
   where commands or remote control of vehicular components are possible
   and where monitoring of the entire fleet or subsets thereof is made
   possible by dashboard or operations center features. In some cases,
   these components will be hosted by service providers, while in others
   they may be hosted by the owner. In either case, all the requirements
   identified as being applicable to *Cloud or Back-end* should be
   considered to apply to the device.

-  *Mobile App* – The component of a Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD, which
   presents Human Machine Interfaces to drivers or other users of the
   system, may or may not have its own communications paths to the
   *Cloud or Back-end* and may or may not be hosted in a device separate
   from the *Vehicle Connection Device,* but is otherwise able to
   connect to and communicate with that vehicular component.

A goal of the working group was to ensure that stakeholders who procure
equipment could also be capable of verifying that the equipment
satisfies cybersecurity requirements. Therefore, each requirement
includes a validation step which is intended to be executed by the
purchaser. In some cases, the verification of the cybersecurity
requirement requires more specialized knowledge than is reasonable to
expect the purchaser to have. In these few cases, the validation steps
recommend consulting a 3rd party report.

In recognizing that implementing cybersecurity for systems is an ongoing
process for which there are rarely enough resources, each requirement
has been each assigned a ‘criticality.’ These criticalities can be used
to prioritize implementation by vendors or selection of vendors by
purchasers.

We have avoided any requirements that are novel or otherwise unique in
favor of referencing publicly available authoritative sources; at the

[SECTION]
TITLE: Cybersecurity Requirements for Telematics Systems Matrix Description

[FREETEXT]
Each requirement captured is augmented with *Criticality*, *Verification
Steps*, *Public Requirements References,* etc. A sample requirement is
shown below:

.. image:: media/sample_requirement.png
   :alt: Sample Requirement for Reference
   :class: image

The example requirement above demonstrates the form in which each
requirement is presented in Appendix A.

   **Ref #**

shows a unique value assigned to the requirement for easy reference

   **Category**

groups like requirements together

   **Criticality**

assigns a ‘priority’: a recommendation to the purchaser for each
requirement:

-  **High**: the working group advises that purchasers do not accept
   proposals that do not meet all ‘High’ criticality requirements

-  **Medium**: the working group advises that purchasers may accept
   proposals that do not meet ‘Medium’ criticality requirements when the
   failure is justifiable or mitigated by the vendor

-  **Low**: the working group advises that purchasers may accept
   proposals that do not meet ‘Low’ criticality requirements

..

   **Applicable Component Categories**

shows to which of the components of the Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD that
this requirement applies.

   **Public Requirements References / Descriptions**

shows as many external authoritative requirements as were known to the
working group at the time of this draft. These references are included
so that

-  Purchasers can easily refer to the referenced sections of the
   document for further clarification on what are acceptable norms when
   evaluating vendor responses to RFPs AND

-  Vendors can use the referenced sections of the documents for
   establishing common language and terms in the responses to RFPs to
   amortize the costs of developing detailed responses.

..

   **Requirement**

shows the requirement as it applies to the components of a Telematics,
FMIS and/or ELD. The working group made every effort to make these
requirements shorter and more succinct than the authoritative external
references.

   **Verification**

shows the steps which can be executed by purchasers to confirm that a
given Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD satisfies this requirement. There are
several cases where the working group does not expect that purchasers
will perform their own verification. Where it is recommended that either
a third party be engaged to provide an analysis which can be used by the
purchasers to verify vendor claims, or that the vendor perform a
demonstration that the requirement is satisfied which can be observed
and confirmed by the purchaser. In such cases, rationale will be given.
Due to the costly nature of delegating to a third party or of preparing
a demonstration, this will only be recommended in cases where the
requirement has been listed as having high *Criticality*. Because of the
high *Criticality* of these requirements, it would be ideal to verify
them relying on both a third party and a demonstration; the
recommendation of the working group is that one or the other is
sufficient.

-  In the context of verification via reports from a third party it is
   acceptable to either, as a purchaser, contract the third party for
   testing or to verify documentation provided by a third party
   contracted by the vendor.

-  In the context of demonstration by the vendor, it is important that
   the purchaser ensure the demonstration covers the non-functional
   aspects of these requirements, (e.g. for secure boot it is not
   sufficient to demonstrate that valid images are bootable, but rather
   it is necessary to demonstrate that tampered images are not
   bootable.)

..

   **Remarks**

shows comments or notes from the working group.

[SECTION]
TITLE: Recommendations and Conclusions

[FREETEXT]
The working group has produced the comprehensive list of cybersecurity requirements for Telematics, FMIS and/or ELDs found in Appendix A. These requirements are prioritized via Criticality and assigned to one or more components in a generic Telematics, FMIS and/or ELD. They also include references to public, authoritative sources for more details on the requirement for the benefit of additional understanding on the part of the purchaser and vendor.

The working group recommends that federal agency fleet managers and private industry stakeholders use these requirements when procuring new Telematics, FMIS and/or ELDs, as well as when evaluating their current systems when the need to evaluate cybersecurity arises. It is NMFTA’s recommendation that motor freight carriers use these requirements as a natural successor to “Telematics Cybersecurity Primer for Agencies.” The requirements contained in this report complete several key areas which are missing in the Primer.

The working group continues to refine the requirements and the reader is encouraged to visit https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-telematics_security_requirements to obtain the most up-to-date copy of the requirements, which is also available in a supplier questionnaire format. The site should also be used to give feedback to the working group on ways that the requirements can be further refined.

PUB_REFS: >>>
BSIMM [SE3.2: 13] Use Code Protection
a. To protect intellectual property and make exploit development harder, the organization erects barriers to reverse engineering its software (e.g., anti-tamper, debug protection, anti-piracy features, runtime integrity). This is particularly important for widely distributed mobile applications. For some software, obfuscation techniques could be applied as part of the production build and release process. In other cases, these protections could be applied at the software-defined network or software orchestration layer when applications are being dynamically regenerated post-deployment. On some platforms, employing Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Safe Structured Handling (SafeSEH), and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) can be a good start at making exploit development more difficult.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑1
a. The app detects, and responds to, the presence of a rooted or jailbroken device either by alerting the user or terminating the app.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑2
a. The app prevents debugging and/or detects, and responds to, a debugger being attached. All available debugging protocols must be covered.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑6
a. The app detects, and responds to, tampering the code and data in its own memory space.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑7
a. The app implements multiple mechanisms in each defense category (8.1 to 8.6). Note that resiliency scales with the amount, diversity of the originality of the mechanisms used.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑8
a. The detection mechanisms trigger responses of different types, including delayed and stealthy responses.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑9
a. Obfuscation is applied to programmatic defenses, which in turn impede de-obfuscation via dynamic analysis.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑10
a. The app implements a 'device binding' functionality using a device fingerprint derived from multiple properties unique to the device.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑11
a. All executable files and libraries belonging to the app are either encrypted on the file level and/or important code and data segments inside the executables are encrypted or packed. Trivial static analysis does not reveal important code or data.

OWASP MASVS MSTG‑RESILIENCE‑12
a. If the goal of obfuscation is to protect sensitive computations, an obfuscation scheme is used that is both appropriate for the particular task and robust against manual and automated de-obfuscation methods, considering currently published research. The effectiveness of the obfuscation scheme must be verified through manual testing. Note that hardware-based isolation features are preferred over obfuscation whenever possible.
